It is used for not only coding with some languages such as Python, and C, but also for documentation. You can create, modify, and share doccuments which includes that codes, mathematical equations, plots, and graphics by using Jupiter notebook.\n",

    " To typeset   mathematical formulas including Greek letters using LaTeX Markdown in Jupyter notebooks, you need to use $ signs outside of the LaTeX commands.Also, In order to use the Greek letters, you need to use the bachslash(‘ \\ ’). For example, If you would like to type “a squared”, you first need to put 2 dollar signs. Inside of the daller signs, you can put ‘\\alpha ^2’ which caret denote a superscript\n",

    "One pf the reasons why Python is the most popular programming languages is varsatility, efficiency amd the speed. Python has many built-in librualies and frameworks which save your time to build a code from scrach. Also, the running time by using Python is faster than the other modern languages.\n",
